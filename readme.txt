For the running of our program, we have created a Makefile to make the running of our program. To test our program you can simply type "make ta1" or "make ta2".
Also I have included multiple videos for your testing. Inside the Makefile you can change the frame rate to whatever you'd like

Command to run program :
    make ta1 
    make ta2

How Our Program Is Different:
    Implemented a Play/Pause feature
    Implemented a CaptureFrame button that captures the current frame and saves as a png

    *to use the CaptureFrame button you must pause the video, followed by clicking the CurrentFrame button*

For the running of our program, we have created a Makefile to make the running of our program. To test our program you can simply type "make ta".
Inside the Makefile you can change the frame rate to whatever you'd like

Command to run program :
    make ta

How Our Program Is Different:
    Implemented a Play/Pause feature
    Implemented a CaptureFrame button that captures the current frame and saves as a png

    *to use the CaptureFrame button you must pause the video, followed by clicking the CurrentFrame button*
